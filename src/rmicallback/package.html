<title>RMI Client-Server Callback Example</title>
</head>
<body>
This package contains a simple RMI client-server callback demo with instructions.
<h3>Instructions for running the simple RMI client-server callback demo</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Check out the demo project from CVS.</li>
  <li>Compile the project using ant initially and
  after each modification of the Java code.</li>
  <li>Assume you have chosen two different workstations, ws1 and ws2,
    preferably next to each other in a lab.  (For testing purposes, ws1
    and ws2 can be the same.)  The server will run on ws1, and the client on ws2.</li>
  <li>Open a DOS window on each workstation.  To find out the IP
    (Internet Protocol) Address of a workstation, type
    <pre>ipconfig</pre>
    in a DOS window.  Let ip1 be the IP Addresses of ws1.</li>
  <li>Change to this top-level project directory on both hosts.  On ws1, run
    <pre>ant server</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    On ws2 (and possibly other workstations), run
    <pre>ant -Dserverhost=ip1 client</pre>
    Now you should see some interaction between the client(s) and the server.
  </li>
</ol>
